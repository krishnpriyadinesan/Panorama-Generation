# Panorama-Generation
Panorama generation from images taken with your phones.

This project involved stitching images together to create panoramas. A panoramic image is a wide-angle mosaic image done by combining several still images. Panorama stitching involves solving for the projective transformation between two subsequent images which need to be stitched together.
